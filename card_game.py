'''
Card Game that populates a deck, shuffles it, deals hands to specs, and scores.

Rank and Suit are used to create a sorted deck for reference. Random's shuffle
method is used to shuffle the order of the sorted deck. The game is played by
dealing hands to the number of players for the number of cards specified. The
score is calculated by rank * suit (4=c, 3=h, 2=d, 1=s) and leaderboard posted.
